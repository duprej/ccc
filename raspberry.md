# Using CAC Control Center on a Raspberry Pi

## Usage and performance

I tested my Raspberry Pi Zero WH (armv6l) to act as a Wi-Fi remote access for my CAC-V5000 with the CCCpivot module. Load average of CPU was about 0.20 and <60MB of RAM used in `htop` while communicating (without TLS and node v10.19). So this tiny old model (1Ã—ARM1176JZF-S core of 1Ghz) will clearly do the job in this case.

If you plan to put all modules on your Raspberry Pi, especialy future CCCweb and his database with a webserver, prefer buying a more powerfull model like the Rapsberry Pi 3 or 4 model.

## Installation procedure

This procedure has been tested with success:

- Raspbian Lite (without Desktop) 5.4.51+ 08/2020 / Raspberry Pi Zero WH (armv6l)
- Armbian 20.08.01 / OrangePi PC 1.2 (armv7l)

## 1 - Install Raspberry Pi OS on the SDcard

There is plenty of tutorials for that.

<https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/>

Use a good SDcard.

## 2 - Configure your SBC

Use 'raspi-config' or 'armbian-config' tool.

- Set passwords
- SSH deamon
- Localisation (Locale, TimeZone, Keyboard Map)
- Wi-Fi (SSID, Passphrase)

Please be sure you can access internet at this step.

## 3 - Some tips

On Raspberry Pi OS:

- don't forget to enable ssh deamon to remote control your Raspi:

```console
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

- turn off wireless power management if you have dropouts problems.

Add this line to '/etc/rc.local' file (before exit 0):

```console
iwconfig wlan0 power off
```

Reboot and check with 'iwconfig wlan0' that Power Management is off.

## 4 - Install Node.js & NPM

```console
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
```

Even if the version is not the last one (>=10).

## 5 - Connect your Pioneer CAC autochanger with serial cable

See the [startupGuide.pdf](./startupGuide.pdf).

## 6 - Download and launch serialcheck.sh (check tool)

```console
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duprej/ccc/main/serialcheck.sh
bash serialcheck.sh
```

Before continue, launch this script and confirm that you can control the autochanger at this step. Example:

```console
pi@cacv5000:~ $ bash serialcheck.sh
Welcome to CCC autochanger serial checker script v1.3 for Linux.

This tiny script is interactive and will ask you some questions.
Listing serial ports... 3 found.

Device     | Physical port
------     | -------------
ttyAMA0    | /devices/platform/soc/20201000.serial/tty/ttyAMA0
ttyS0      | /devices/platform/soc/20215040.serial/tty/ttyS0
ttyUSB0    | /devices/platform/soc/20980000.usb/usb1/1-1/1-1.1/1-1.1:1.0/ttyUSB0/tty/ttyUSB0

Please select a serial port:
1) ttyAMA0
2) ttyS0
3) ttyUSB0
#? 3
You have chosen ttyUSB0.
Please select an autochanger model:
1) CAC-V180M
2) CAC-V3000/V3200/V5000
#? 2
You have chosen CAC-V3000/V3200/V5000.

## 7 - Check if you have git

If you don't have it installed:

```console
sudo apt-get install git
```

## 8 - Clone and install CCCpivot

Tip to install lastest Node.js on armv6l (Raspberry Pi Zero) :

```console
wget https://unofficial-builds.nodejs.org/download/release/v14.15.4/node-v14.15.4-linux-armv6l.tar.xz
tar -xvf node-v14.15.4-linux-armv6l.tar.xz -C /usr/ --strip 1
node -v
```

```console
sudo -- bash  -c 'cd /opt && git clone https://github.com/duprej/cccpivot && cd /opt/cccpivot/ && npm install --unsafe-perm'
```

## 9 - Clone and configure CCClauncher

```console
sudo -- bash  -c 'cd /opt;git clone https://github.com/duprej/ccclauncher'
```

Install Perl modules:

```console
sudo apt-get install -y libconfig-simple-perl libdbi-perl libproc-simple-perl libswitch-perl libtext-csv-perl && sudo cpan -iT String::Util
```

Copy the systemd unit file & enable at startup:

```console
sudo cp /opt/ccclauncher/ccclauncher.service /etc/systemd/system/ccclauncher.service && sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable ccclauncher
```

Install basic config files:

```console
sudo cp /opt/ccclauncher/conf/* /etc/
```

Configure/Personalize theses files with a text editor (nano, vi, gedit...):

```console
sudo vi /etc/ccclauncher.cfg
sudo vi /etc/cccchangers.csv
```

Start your CCCpivot processes:

```console
sudo perl /opt/ccclauncher/launcher.pl start
```

Check if your CCCpivot processes are alive:

```console
ps -ef|grep node
```

```console
sudo perl /opt/ccclauncher/launcher.pl status
```
